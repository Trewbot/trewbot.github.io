        Hello, welcome to my on-line homepage; I am Trevor

		Trewbot! I am a writer and developer, currently enrolled at the
		<a href="https://uwrf.edu">University of Wisconsin-River Falls</a>
		studying physics, mathematics, and computer science.

    <p>
        My writing interests range from fun comedy projects to super serious
		political discussions. Relevant to that, my political and philosophical
		interests are absurdism, accelerationism, anarcho-syndicalism, direct
		action/praxis, prefigurativism, technogaianism, technoprogressivism, and
		transhumanism.

	<p>
		In the school year from 2015-2016, I began volunteering at the
		<a href="http://uwrfvoice.com/">UWRF Student Voice</a> as the front page
		editor. I had originally joined in order to write columns, but they were
		in need of another editor. I still ended up writing some columns that I
		had intended to be serious about, but they eventually devolved into more
		satirical and filler content. Here are the columns I wrote, ordered by
		publication date:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://uwrfvoice.com/etcetera/14704">
			UWRF Society of Physics Students Chapter visits 3M</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://uwrfvoice.com/etcetera/14981">
			Office chair provides fun, convenience, comfort</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://uwrfvoice.com/viewpoints/15181">
			Einstein's Theory of General Relativity explains occurrences in the
			universe</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://uwrfvoice.com/etcetera/15411">
			A student's guide to pencils</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://uwrfvoice.com/etcetera/15704">
			The feasibility of spontaneously morphing into an octopus</a></li>
	</ul>

		After <a href="https://youtu.be/qFMGggjO2QY">recording a reading</a> of
		the entirety of
		<a href="https://twitter.com/ruinedpicnic">Ruinedpicnic</a> et. al.'s
		<a href="https://www.docdroid.net/agHSBmI">E.T.2</a> in early January
		2017, I went on to join <a href="https://goo.gl/6VphYj">another reading
		</a> starring a cast of various good twitter users (all of whom you
		should follow). Throughout 2017, I also contributed to the writing of
		more scripts, all written within 24 hours. Those are all listed here,
		chronologically:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.docdroid.net/tm2dnu4">
			Opposite Jurassic Park</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.docdroid.net/zroLOXH">

		<li><a href="https://www.docdroid.net/Nphxbj2">

    <p>
        Unlike my writing, the programming and software development I do is a
		lot more closely related to my actual studies. I taught myself
		programming through web development in high school, and went on to apply
		to college as a computer science major. Due to certain issues with the
		program I was able to get into, this was eventually downgraded to a
		minor, with my major being changed to a double major in Physics and
		Mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the most part, my original focus on web development has held out
		over time. A lot of my works in physics and math, and even regular
		programming, have been either solely created for or adapted for the web.

	<p>
		While it's never been something I've focused on, I have also done some
		graphic design. This, of course, varies a bit, encompassing page layouts
		to logo and branding.

		<b>"ORCA"</b> was the proposed name for the high power rocket team at
		<a href="https://www.uwrf.edu/PHYS/">UWRF's physics department</a> for
		the <a href="https://goo.gl/gVdaSj">2015-2016 Midwest High-Power Rocket
		Competition</a>. The name and design were never officially adopted. They
		were, however, used on <a href="r/rocket/2015/proposal/6.pdf">the grant
		proposal</a> for the project. <i>It is possible that the branding may be
		used in the future, as it is not necessarily unique to rocketry and the
		original project for which it was designed is an annual one.</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>Student Voice</b> was mentioned earlier in the
		<a href="#columns">writing</a> section because I had written
		<a href="http://uwrfvoice.com/author/hoglund">columns</a> for them.
		While I was working there (from 2015-2016), I was mainly tasked with
		editing the front page. This entailed reading through the articles meant
		to be placed on the first or third pages, checking for any errors that
		had been missed, and placing them on the pages along with photos or
		pullquotes to make them fit the pages perfectly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Near the end of fall 2015, the editorial team began discussing the
		creation of a logo for the paper, citing that there was no consistent
		branding between the digital and physical media that they produced. I
		proposed a minimalist falcon design that was included in the header of
		the paper for the duration of the spring 2016 semester. This was never
		implemented on the website and, for reasons never announced, was removed
		from the physical paper's header by fall 2016.

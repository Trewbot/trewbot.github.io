		hello, im <a href="http://trew.moe">trevor hoglund (trewbot)</a>,<br>
		<br>
		im a developer/writer, focusing on data security and political theory respectively.
		until recently, i was attending <a href="http://uwrf.edu">uwrf</a>,
		double majoring in physics n mathematics, n minoring in computer science.
		i was suspended for my semester gpa falling below 1.000,
		as i had not gone to the majority of my classes due to some mental issues.
		im depressed af n u can watch me rant abt my life falling apart on my <a href="https://twitter.com/trewbot">twitter</a>.
		in general im into pretty minimalist/brutalist things.
	</p>
	<p>
		my main development project is <a href="http://gra.phene.co">graphene</a>
		(likely down for the time being, you can view the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Trewbot/Graphene/">github</a>).
		ive also made a few fun web pages:
		<a href="http://trew.moe/js/3/waves">revolution.js</a> is a normally distributed cluster of (h&amp;s) sprites with a simulated spherical wave expanding outward,
		this is built using <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>.
		<a href="http://trew.moe/js/phys/poisson">this poisson graph</a> is an interactive poisson graph,
		this is very useful for visualizing how the mean affects the shape of the distribution.
		<a href="http://trew.moe/js/phys/gravity">gravity</a> is a 2d newtonian gravity simulator,
		you can add an object by clicking, hold down to add mass, dragging for velocity, n letting go to release
		(this is actually rendered in html and not canvas, i may change this later).
		there are also a bunch of javascript libraries ive made during the development of graphene at <a href="http://scripts.phene.co">scripts.phene.co</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		if you've read any of my writing it was probably a contribution to one of these projects:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.docdroid.net/tm2dnu4">opposite jurassic park</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.docdroid.net/zroLOXH">the muppets yakuza</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.docdroid.net/Nphxbj2">sonic's last adventure</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		or, less likely, my <a href="http://uwrfvoice.com/author/hoglund">articles</a> for the student newspaper at uwrf.
		my favorite is the one about turning into an octopus, they don't publish things like that anymore.
		i was also the front page editor there from fall 2015 to spring 2016.
		also technically writing is my blog, either
		<a href="http://b.trew.moe">tumblr</a> or <a href="https://trewbot.svbtle.com">svbtle</a>.
		im working on some essays to discuss more political ideology in the future,
		comedy has just been the easier to finish writing.
	</p>
	<p>
		on the topic of philosophy, my ideologies are overall very leftist:
		accelerationism, anarcho-syndicalism, squadism, technogaianism, n transhumanism.
		sociologically i believe strongly in situationism and social constructivism.
		politically i support the <a href="http://www.dsausa.org/">DSA</a> as a practical means for a movement of leftist solidarity.
	</p>

		for your multimedia fix you can check out my personal youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqk_-WJiBionWuh8wmmVrmw">channel</a>
		or my newer leftist meme <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HsBGB0z0g77wVdrCssgIQ">channel</a>.
		if you want to listen to my voice for three to six hours, i read the entire
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_wCUz9ntKwsWE_UntzmVwq8gw3d5lK0ydcfaOr7QvI">e.t.2 script</a> in this
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQsBywQKmCvREZuzYUMHN7N-sFD6bGh3C">playlist</a>
		and also on this <a href="https://omny.fm/shows/now-we-re-talking/special-episode-e-t-2-part-1">podcast</a>.
		i do also post a lot of videos/memes on my <a href="https://twitter.com/trewbot">twitter</a>.
		i post to my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trewbot/">instagram</a> about once per day on average.

		including my dumb <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Trewbot">list of anime ive seen</a> bc my life has always been spiraling into oblivion.

                                                            did it fix anything?

no
i couldnt even sleep
it was hot in my room
i had a dream

                                                          tell me abt this dream

i dont understand it
it made no sense
ive been working on some things
code and math-wise
n i feel like
thats what i dreamt
i wasnt asleep completely
i could feel myself being
dragged awake
by idk wat
i was too hot
i was following something
focusing on it
but it wasnt real
it was dragging me
i was being dragged
it hurt
mentally
not physically
i was numb
physically
i wasnt scared
but i felt like i should be
it was exhausting

                                                          but you were sleeping?

		<h1>AP Chem Notes (WIP)</h1>
		<p>
			so the month is april, date the fourth*.
			ap exams are a month away and i signed up for the chemistry exam w/o attending the class &there4; i am taking notes independently.
			idk how to order these but i dont think it matters.
			i asked how they did it in the class but perhaps i shall do them numerically according to the book.
		</p>
		<p>
			i really dont care that much abt chemistry tbh, like, i like it but im really only doing these notes to flesh out the process n styling for more important notes, like my calc n diffeq notes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>*this is all directly copied from the notes from 2015, it's like 2017 now.
			im basically just transcribing the notes but writing words n abbreviates how i do now.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			key: <kw>keywords</kw>, <hist>historical person/event</hist>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.1">
		<h2>&sect;1.1 atoms n molecules</h2>
		<p>
			<kw>atoms</kw> are things, <kw>molecules</kw> are also things, it's fairly hype.
			uhh... thats just abt the whole &sect;... maybe i'll mark the table of contents based on chapters not each section...
			these science textbooks are just so quick to declare a new section while the calc textbook has like 10 page sections.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.2">
		<h2>&sect;1.2 a scientific approach to knowledge</h2>
		<p>
			min 14 of caring abt chemistry: everything is tedious n fuck science.
			the, ug, 'observations' lead to making a <kw>hypothesis</kw> n u test this using <kw>experiments</kw>...
			this can eventuall lead to creating a <kw>scientific law</kw>.
			one or mote hypotheses can form a <kw>theory</kw> blah blah blah <kw>atomic theory</kw> blah blah blah they have a chart...
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.3">
		<h2>&sect;1.3 the classification of matter</h2>
		<p>
			<kw>matter</kw> is anything that occupies space and has mass... vague as hell...
			a specification of matter is called a <kw>substance</kw>.
			'we' classify it based on <kw>state</kw> n <kw>composition</kw>.
			anwyay, blah blah blah <kw>solid &rarr; liquid &rarr; gas</kw> (&rarr; plasma, oh right, high school).
			<kw>crystalline</kw> solids have structures, <kw>amorphous</kw> dont, they also dont have an exact emlting point.
			gases are free to move abt &there4; compressible.
			here's a chart:
		</p>
		[insert chart from p23]
		<p>
			how to separate mixtures!
			<kw>decanting</kw> is a 10/10 procedure, fucking hype!
			u carefully pour loquid! like sand-water, u just pour the water out!
			<kw>distillation</kw> is what u do to appear particularly sciency, u boil the mixture so the more <kw>volatile</kw>/easily boiled liquid basically runs the hell awya.
			if u mix and insolubile solid w a liquid u can just <kw>filter</kw> it...
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.4">
		<h2>&sect;1.4 physical n chemical changes/properties</h2>
		<p>
			a change in state/appearance w/o changing composition is called a <kw>physical change</kw> whereas a change in composition is a <kw>chemical change</kw>.
			same goes for properties: a <kw>physical property</kw> is something displayed w/o a compositional change n a <kw>chemical proprty</kw> is displayed w ditto.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.5">
		<h2>&sect;1.5 energy</h2>
		<p>
			<kw>energy</kw> is the capacity to do work.
			<kw>work</kw> is force over distance.
			<kw>kinetic energy</kw> is that of motion, while <kw>potential energy</kw> is that of position, combined these become total energy.
			the <kw>law of conservation of energY</kw> is pretty god damn obvious.
			blah blah blah.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.6">
		<h2>&sect;1.6 units of measurement</h1>
		<p>
			we <i>scientists</i> use <kw>si units</kw> based on the <kw>metric system</kw>, pretty cool.
			si is an abbr of systeme internation d'unites bc france for some reason is important... lol.
			here's the units:
		</p>
		<table style="width:100%">
			<thead>
				<td style="width:30%">quantity</td>
				<td style="width:30%">unit</td>

			if u arent an infant the rest of this (n the aforementioned as well) is nothing new so im going to move on now... fucking textbooks.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="2.2">
		<h2>&sect;2.2 early ideas</h2>
		<p>
			im skipping &sect;&sect;1.7-2.1 bc i want to preserver paper for shit that matters*.
			significant figures n other ppl's inaccuracies do not classify
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>*this is funny bc a) this is no longer on paper, n b) ive never filled a single notebook since i started doing notes like this</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<hist>democritus (460-370bce)</hist> wrote "nothing exists except atoms n empty space; everything else is opinion."
			then a bunch of other dudes did science.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="2.3">
		<h2>&sect;2.3 modern atomic theory</h2>
		<p>
			in 1789, <hist>antoine lavoisier</hist> formulated the <kw>law of conservation of mass</kw>,
			wherein he stated that in a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.
			8yrs later, in 1797, <hist>joseph proust</hist> (a french dude) summarized his observations in the <kw>law of definite proportions</kw>:
			all samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared, have the same proportions of the constituent elements...
			pretty fucking obvious, that's what make them said compound &#x1F611;.
			in 1804, <hist>john dalton</hist> published his <kw>law of multiple proportions</kw>:
			when two elements, A n B, form two different compounds, the masses of element B that combine w one gram of A can be expressed as a ration of small whole numbers.
			pimpin' aint easy but elementary chemistry is*.
		</p>
		<p>
			in 1808, john dalton explained this all as <kw>atomic theory</kw>.
			i would, ofc, write out the whole thing... literally none of this is important...
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>*pls excuse how dumb some of the things in here r, i was studying an entire course during what turned out to be like the worst week of my life, at least emotionally speaking</i>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.2">
		<h2>&sect;3.2 chemical bonds</h2>
		<p>
			to summarize the shit im skipping:
			jj thompson did the cathode ray thing... iirc his desk is still radioactive, electrons were discovered,
			marie curie did a thing n shit was named after her, дмитрий менделеев did a thing w a table, iupac has standards (unlike some people) n atoms have mass,
			molar mass is mass n moles, blah blah my life is going to shit.
		</p>
		<p>
			thinking of elementary chemistry n particle physics @ the same time is bad, stop doing that...
			anyway: <kw>ionic bonds</kw> are oppositely charged ions bonding due to electrostatic force;
			<kw>covalent bonds</kw> share electrons... making a covalent bond get it? cuz they share valent electrons? lol.
			anyway these are called <kw>molecular compounds</kw>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.3">
		<h2>&sect;3.3 taxation w/o representation*</h2>
		<p>
			<i>*i think this was a pun abt the original section name, idgi tho,,, mb something abt the molecular representations? idk it's just bad</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			just use <kw>chemical formulae</kw>: an <kw>emprical formula</kw> give relative amounts while <kw>molecular forumlae</kw> give actual numbers...
			a <kw>structural formula</kw> uses lines to represent the bonds, here's the book's shitty example:
			hydrogen peroxide ($\ce{H2O2}$): $\ce{H-O-O-H}$...
			u can also represent geometry n double bonds w this shit n i feel like im going to throw up, not just bc the simplicity of this shit.
		</p>
		<p>
			molecular models are a thing (probably).
			a <kw>ball-n-stick molecular model</kw> uses... uh... balls... and the other thing... oh! sticks! to represent the molecule.
			whereas the <kw>space-filling molecular model</kw> fills in space!
			they mention tetrahedrons here but its not really important until later.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.4">
		<h2>&sect;3.4 an atomic view of stuff</h2>
		<p>
			i rly need to stop taking so long on these early chapters...
			<kw>atomic elements</kw> are typically themselves in anture whereas <kw>molecular elements</kw> aren't.
			<kw>molecular compounds</kw> are covalently bonded while <kw>ionic compounds</kw> are ionic bonded...
			the fewest conglomerated ions it takes to be electrically neutral is the <kw>formula unit</kw>.
			a <kw>polyatomic ion</kw> is an ion composed of poly atoms.
			SO TIRED DAMN!
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.5">
		<h2>&sect;3.5 ionic compounds - things!</h2>
		<p>
			many lame compounds are found in the crust cuz y not.
			so lets write them!
			first take two elements, find their charges, put the cation first, multiple their charges of w/e by numbers to get a balanced charge:
			i.e. $\ce{Al^3+, O^2-... Al2O2}$ easy as pie.
		</p>
		<p>
			elements have <kw>common names</kw> which are familiarities<sup>?</sup>, and <kw>systematic names</kw> which are found by a simple algorithm.
			normally one is metal n one non, and some elements just fuck w the naming convention.
		</p>
		<p>
			"naming binary ionic compounds containing a metal that forms only one type of cation"... <kw>name of cation + base name of anion + ide</kw>,
			i.e. calcium chloride...
			"naming binary compounds containing a metal that forms more than one kind of cation":
			same thing but w a charge in the middle: <kw>cation (charge) anion + ide</kw>
			i.e. copper (II) oxide...
			"naming ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions"... <kw>anion-cation</kw>, n here's a list of polyatomic iont to memorize:

	<div id="3.6">
		<h2>&sect;3.6 molecular things!</h2>
		<p>
			naming molecular compounds is fairly straighforward, for binary nonmetals it is: <kw>prefix-element prefix-elemenent-ide</kw>.
			mono is ommitted from the first one bc it got its ??? i.e. nitrogen monoxide.
		</p>
		<p>
			for now <kw>acids</kw> are molecules that emit a H<sup>+</sup>.
			<kw>Binary acids</kw> contain a hydrogen &amp; a non-metal, we name them <kw>hydro-element-ic acid</kw> i.e. hydrobromic acid.
			the spine is really hitting me today.* :l
			<kw>oxyacids</kw> are an acid with a hydrogen &amp; an oxyanion.
			if it's a -ate then <kw>oxyanion-ic acid</kw>, or -ite: <kw>oxyanion-ous acid</kw>.
			i.e. nitrate &rarr; nitric acid, sulfite &rarr; sulfurous acid.

	<div id="3.8">
		<h2>&sect;3.8 formula mass</h2>
		<p>
			the <kw>formula mass/molecular mass</kw> is
			$$\sum_{k=0}^n N_k*m_k$$
			where $n$ is the number of unique elements, $N_k$ is the number of element $k$ in the molecule, n $m_k$ is the atomic mass of element $k$.
			the molecular mass is numerically equivalent to the <kw>moral mass</kw> except the latter is in g/mol rather than amu.
			to get the ampount of molecules in a sample just divide the mass by the molar mass then multiple by <kw>Avogadro's number</kw>.
		</p>

	<div id="3.9">
		<h2>&sect;3.9 composition</h2>
		<p>
			$$P = \frac{m_x}{m_{mol}} \times 100%$$
			where $P$ is the percentage of the mass of a compound contributed by element $x$, $m_x$ is the mass of element $x$ in 1mol of the compound, n $m_{mol}$ is the mass of 1mol of the compound.
			if you're really cleaver this can get you the molecular formula...
			by measuring chemicals put in and their molar ratios.
			you can use <kw>empirical formula molar mass</kw> to make a ratio and from there get a full thing:
			$$F_{molecular} = \frac{m_{mol}}{m_{mol_{emp}}} \times F_{empirical}$$
			where $F_{molecular}$ is the molecular formula, $m_{mol}$ is the molar mass, $m_{mol_{emp}}$ is the empirical formula molar mass, n $F_{empirical}$ is the empricial formula.

		<h2>&sect;3.11 chemical equations</h2>
		<p>
			a <kw>chemical reaction</kw> is a reaction of chemicals, a <kw>combustion reaction</kw> is a specific type that a molecule combines w $\ce{O2}$ to make $\ce{CO2}$ &amp; $\ce{H2O}$
			we represent these w <kw>chemical equations</kw> such as: $\ce{CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O}$... such that it goes reactants &rarr; products.
			these need to be <kw>balanced</kw> so that the same number of an element is on each side.
			we can also label states:

			<kw>stoichiometry</kw> is a numerical relationing<sup>?</sup> in a chemical reaction.
			this is all done w math i could train a dog to do but just know its finding amnts of stuff.
			in which the <kw>limiting reactant</kw> is the one whose value produces the least product.
			the <kw> theoretical yield</kw> is the amnt of product u could produce w the limiting reactant and blah blah blah.
			a <kw>solution</kw> is a solute dissolved in a <kw>solvent</kw>.
			an <kw>aqueous solution</kw> has a water soolvent.
			something something <kw>$M_1V_1=M_2V_2$</kw>, molarity is $M$ and volume $V$... n u thought it was the law of conservation of momentum, lol!.

			a <kw>precipitation reaction</kw> is when (aq) compounds react to form a solid that is called the <kw>precipitate</kw>.
			some people denote this (&darr;).
			you can predict this w the above chart.
		</p>
		<p>
			an <kw>acid</kw> produces a proton/$\ce{H^+}$ in aqueous solution and a <kw>base</kw> produces a $\ce{HO^-}$ thingy that accepts the $\ce{H^+}$.
			these react in an <kw>acid-base/neutralization reaction</kw>.
			oh, and there are the <kw>arrhenius definitions</kw>.
			<kw>polyprotic</kw> acids obviously give multiple protongs, while <kw>diprotic</kw> is specfically two.
			the reaction often forms water n salt.
			a <kw>net ionic equation</kw> removes the <kw>spectator ions</kw> that don't "react," moreso the form a salt.
			a <kw>titration</kw> is a lab thing where u mix the sol'n of known concentration w a unknown one to calculare said concentration by the means of the whole system changing color at the <kw>equivalence point</kw> due to an <kw>indicator</kw> showing the pH level of 7 or something.
		</p>
		<p>
			an <kw>oxidation-reduction/redox reaction</kw> is where electrons transfer from one reactant to another.
			<kw>oxidation</kw> is giving an $\ce{e^-}$, mostly done by $\ce{O}$, while <kw>reduction</kw> is gaining an $\ce{e^-}$, called so bc the charge is reduced.
			well now i have to explain the whole fucking <kw>oxidation state/number</kw> thing.
			this is the "charge," it would have <i>if</i> sharing.
			diatomic elements are @ zero: $\underset{0}{\ce{Cu}}$, $\underset{0}{\ce{Cl2}}$ but ions be like this: $\underset{+2}{\ce{Ca^2+}}$, $\underset{-1}{\ce{Cl^-}}$.
			example: $\ce{H2O ->}2(\ce{H ox}) + 1(\ce{O ox}) = 0$ bc there is "no charge".
		</p>
		<p>
			so in order to do these:
			1) a free atom is 0,
			2) a monoatomic ion is equal to its charge,
			3) sum of ox. states is equal to the charge of the compound,
			4) metals have positive ox. states,
			5) nonmetals follow this table:

		<h2>&sect;5.2 pressure</h2>
		<p>
			now i can easily put that song in your head: "under pressure...", so dank.*
			anyway, <kw>pressure (p)</kw> is force over area $f/a$.
			which was kind of obvious.
			so in what units do we measure this, well <hist>evangelista torricelli</hist> invented a mercury barometer we we'll call it <kw>torrs</kw>...
			or millimeters of mercury (mmHg) of which there are 760mmHg at sea level.
			an atmosphere is the average at sea level: 1atm = 760mmHg.
			but bc we're <i>scientists</i>, we use si: <kw>pascals (Pa)</kw> which are N/m<sup>2</sup>.

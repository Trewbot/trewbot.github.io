so, in a group chat earlier (one my roommate pushed me into) 
they were discussing some nostalgic stuff from when they were in highschool
n it sorta made me look at some of my own stuff
n right after that i ended up coming across a playthrough of The Begginner's Guide
n it's got me thinking of some stuff, right,
n there's a couple of ideas i've had for games that i wanted to write down/discuss w someone but not like anyone who like really knows me so read this or not im just gonna explain them:

1. a game where you have to make a bunch of decisions,
	some immediate n some more long term,
	a lot of them would be hidden in the context but you would at the time feel like u were deciding something,
	but in every case the decision has no actual effect on the outcome,
	be it of a certain situation or the game as a whole,
	it isn't exactly linear per se but it does average out to that by the end

2. a more complex decision tree,
	like one that you're constantly making decisions,
	i was thinking it would be about a relationship,
	n as a straight male id suppose it would be the main character as a male n the love interest a female,
	but you wouldn't follow the story in a linear timeline,
	so you would jump all over the decision tree,
	making different choices n whatnot,
	but when you go back in time to a point in the tree earlier,
	youll be forced to make decisions that will make the one youve already made possible,
	otherwise youll die or she'll tie or something that makes you feel as if youve failed without a blatant "GAME OVER" screen,,,

i feel like the first one is more technically accessible,
but that it would only be good if it were used as like a commentary on decision making in games?

but the second one is definitely more, like, mentally involved?
like you would end up with the same sense of futility,
n HOPEFULLY also sort of end up feeling like youre just looking back and imagining the whole thing?
that sort of "what could have been" ideology,
so the end game could be like waking up or something /shrug

		<h1><a href="#0.0">AP Art History Notes (WIP)</a></h1>
		<p>
			These notes don't actually cover the entire course, I ended up giving up some time in.
			There are a lot of sketches I did in my original notes, I may try to redo these or I may just take the screenshots and embed them.
			This is my second page of transcripted notes, I'm going to try a more conventional styling for these than I did the chemistry notes.
			(I'm actually on the fence about going back to the chem ones and restyling the text)

		<h2><a href="#1.0">Ch.1 Art Before History</a></h2>
		<p>
			We start with <kw>paleolithic art</kw>, lithic meaning "stone" and paleo meaning "like I fucking care."
			There are 36 chapters of this shit, I really want to get it over with.
			Around 30,000 BCE, we saw an upsurge of human creativity.
			I really need to find somebody to study with because this is excessively boring.
			This breaks down to a basis of art and the goal of representation.
			In the case of this period it's all about animals.
			Mostly in profile.
			The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_Cave">Apollo 11 cave</a> has some shit in it.
			After a long ass time they finally did a little thing called variety.
			Moving on to Western Europe...
			wait, note, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makapansgat_pebble"><kw>Makapansgat Pebble</kw></a> is a South African piece from 3,000,000 BCE that looks like a face.
			<kw>Animal Facing Left</kw> is an animal facing left, in 23,000 BCE, charcoal on stone from Namibia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Back to Western Europe.
			I'll start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohlenstein-Stadel"><kw>Hohlenstein-Stadel</kw></a> wherein <kw>Human with Feline Head</kw> (ca. 30-28k BCE) was found.
			This is the earliest known sculpture, from clay, and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_HReR_McQ">creative</a>.
			The book claims it depicts a person with a mask but really it is of a superior alien race of Lion-Human hybrids.
			The near east and Egypt were much more into this furry shit.
			We have no clue what these perverted assholes had in mind but all we know is that they thought it was important.
			Onto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyTFyqPfhsQ"><kw>Venus of Willendorf</kw></a> of which the book can't decide between Austria and Germany for the geography.
			Artists tended to depict women (dubbed "Venuses") in the nude... this particular example just looks like a blob with genitalia.
			28-25k BCE overall was a bitchin' time for artwork.
			This was possible a fertility image?
			Either way&hellip; naturalism <i>was not</i> the goal here.
			Precision dating is impossible&hellip; great relationship advice.
			Anyway this usually leads to no more specificity than a range of a few thousand years.
			The <kw>Venus of Laussel relief</kw> (ca. 25-20k BCE) is another prime example of misproportionate female figures carved by primitve peoples.
			It was found in Laussel, France in a big ass rock.
		</p>
		<p>
			We stick to France for yet another thrilling adventure of <i>Rocks</i>.
			This time being two bison in the work duly names <kw>Two Bison</kw>, both of whom were carves in strict profile&hellip; good for them.
			They were in clay against a large free-standing rock and all this was in Le Tuc d'Audobert in fucking France.
			God damn this all&hellip; so hard to concentrate when alone reading a 1,000+ page book about such boring shit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's something more interesting: more bison from 12k BCE France!
			Ironically this was carved into a reindeer horn.
			The body has the heard carved into it, but facing the opposite direction, we call it: <kw>Bison with head turned</kw>!
			A fragment from a spear thrower in La Madeleine, France.
			I forgot to earlier mention the woman in Laussel was hold a bison horn.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not satisfied with bison yet?
			Then I must introduce to you: <kw>Bison</kw>, detail at a painted ceiling in the care at Altamira, Spain (ca. 12-11k BCE),
			each bison being 5' long (like my dick, he joked sad and lonely).
			Apparently a dude with a really long name accidentally found the first cave paintings in 1879.
			Anyway, they take the same approach as 10k year older paintings: everything in profile.
			Some are alive and stading while others are curled up, either dead or giving birth (or both, nobody really knows).
			They don't have a common ground line, losers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Paleolithic <kw>cave paintings</kw> ranged from hundreds to thousands of feet long.
			We've got like 200 examples now&hellip; thet were probably lit by some stone lamps using fat or something with moss as a wick.
			Large flat stones were their <kw>palettes</kw>, and brushes were made from just whatever.
			Studies claim that they could paint huge-ass areas in just a day! Good for them.
			And I will continue to make fun of the naming of things such as <kw>Spotted horses and negative hand imprints</kw> from ca. 22k BCE in, you guessed it, France.
			Pech-Merte specifically.
			Actually, most hand prints were negative in art.
			They may just have been signatures.
			These were <kw>murals</kw> meaning that they were ont he well.
		</p>
		<p>
			So why did they paint so many fucking bison?
			Maybe the were to teach the younglings what to kill, or maybe the were conservationist agenda posters?
			Who knows, either way I don't fucking care.
			Though this comes along with a better named work: <kw>Hall of the Bulls</kw>, from the ave at Lascaux&hellip; France.
			The largest bull being 11'6".
			Some bulls were outlined and the rest are silhouettes.

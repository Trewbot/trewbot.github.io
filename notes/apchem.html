		<h1>ap chem notes</h1>
		<p>
			so the month is april, date the fourth*.
			ap exams are a month away and i signed up for the chemistry exam w/o attending the class &there4; i am taking notes independently.
			idk how to order these but i dont think it matters.
			i asked how they did it in the class but perhaps i shall do them numerically according to the book.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>*this is all directly copied from the notes from 2015, it's like 2017 now.
			im basically just transcribing the notes but writing words n abbreviates how i do now.</i>

	<div id="1.1">
		<h2>&sect;1.1 atoms n molecules</h2>
		<p>
			<kw>atoms</kw> are things, <kw>molecules</kw> are also things, it's fairly hype.
			uhh... thats just abt the whole &sect;... maybe i'll mark the table of contents based on chapters not each section...
			these science textbooks are just so quick to declare a new section while the calc textbook has like 10 page sections.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.2">
		<h2>&sect;1.2 a scientific approach to knowledge</h2>
		<p>
			min 14 of caring abt chemistry: everything is tedious n fuck science.
			the, ug, 'observations' lead to making a <kw>hypothesis</kw> n u test this using <kw>experiments</kw>...
			this can eventuall lead to creating a <kw>scientific law</kw>.
			one or mote hypotheses can form a <kw>theory</kw> blah blah blah <kw>atomic theory</kw> blah blah blah they have a chart...
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.3">
		<h2>&sect;1.3 the classification of matter</h2>
		<p>
			<kw>matter</kw> is anything that occupies space and has mass... vague as hell...
			a specification of matter is called a <kw>substance</kw>.
			'we' classify it based on <kw>state</kw> n <kw>composition</kw>.
			anwyay, blah blah blah <kw>solid &rarr; liquid &rarr; gas</kw> (&rarr; plasma, oh right, high school).
			<kw>crystalline</kw> solids have structures, <kw>amorphous</kw> dont, they also dont have an exact emlting point.
			gases are free to move abt &there4; compressible.
			here's a chart:
		</p>
		[insert chart from p23]
		<p>
			how to separate mixtures!
			<kw>decanting</kw> is a 10/10 procedure, fucking hype!
			u carefully pour loquid! like sand-water, u just pour the water out!
			<kw>distillation</kw> is what u do to appear particularly sciency, u boil the mixture so the more <kw>volatile</kw>/easily boiled liquid basically runs the hell awya.
			if u mix and insolubile solid w a liquid u can just <kw>filter</kw> it...
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.4">
		<h2>&sect;1.4 physical n chemical changes/properties</h2>
		<p>
			a change in state/appearance w/o changing composition is called a <kw>physical change</kw> whereas a change in composition is a <kw>chemical change</kw>.
			same goes for properties: a <kw>physical property</kw> is something displayed w/o a compositional change n a <kw>chemical proprty</kw> is displayed w ditto.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.5">
		<h2>&sect;1.5 energy</h2>
		<p>
			<kw>energy</kw> is the capacity to do work.
			<kw>work</kw> is force over distance.
			<kw>kinetic energy</kw> is that of motion, while <kw>potential energy</kw> is that of position, combined these become total energy.
			the <kw>law of conservation of energY</kw> is pretty god damn obvious.
			blah blah blah.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="1.6">
		<h2>&sect;1.6 units of measurement</h1>
		<p>
			we <i>scientists</i> use <kw>si units</kw> based on the <kw>metric system</kw>, pretty cool.
			si is an abbr of systeme internation d'unites bc france for some reason is important... lol.
			here's the units:
		</p>
		<table style="width:100%">
			<thead>
				<td style="width:30%">quantity</td>

		<p>
			if u arent an infant the rest of this (n the aforementioned as well) is nothing new so im going to move on now... fucking textbooks.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="2.2">
		<h2>&sect;2.2 early ideas</h2>
		<p>
			im skipping &sect;&sect;1.7-2.1 bc i want to preserver paper for shit that matters*.
			significant figures n other ppl's inaccuracies do not classify
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>*this is funny bc a) this is no longer on paper, n b) ive never filled a single notebook since i started doing notes like this</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<hist>democritus (460-370bce)</hist> wrote "nothing exists except atoms n empty space; everything else is opinion."
			then a bunch of other dudes did science.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="2.3">
		<h2>&sect;2.3 modern atomic theory</h2>
		<p>
			in 1789, <hist>antoine lavoisier</hist> formulated the <kw>law of conservation of mass</kw>,
			wherein he stated that in a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.
			8yrs later, in 1797, <hist>joseph proust</hist> (a french dude) summarized his observations in the <kw>law of definite proportions</kw>:
			all samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared, have the same proportions of the constituent elements...
			pretty fucking obvious, that's what make them said compound -_-.
			in 1804, <hist>john dalton</hist> published his <kw>law of multiple proportions</kw>:
			when two elements, A n B, form two different compounds, the masses of element B that combine w one gram of A can be expressed as a ration of small whole numbers.
			pimpin' aint easy but elementary chemistry is*.
		</p>
		<p>
			in 1808, john dalton explained this all as <kw>atomic theory</kw>.
			i would, ofc, write out the whole thing... literally none of this is important...
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>*pls excuse how dumb some of the things in here r, i was studying an entire course during what turned out to be like the worst week of my life, at least emotionally speaking</i>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.2">
		<h2>&sect;3.2 chemical bonds</h2>
		<p>
			to summarize the shit im skipping:
			jj thompson did the cathode ray thing... iirc his desk is still radioactive, electrons were discovered,
			marie curie did a thing n shit was named after her, дмитрий менделеев did a thing w a table, iupac has standards (unlike some people) n atoms have mass,
			molar mass is mass n moles, blah blah my life is going to shit.
		</p>
		<p>
			thinking of elementary chemistry n particle physics @ the same time is bad, stop doing that...
			anyway: <kw>ionic bonds</kw> are oppositely charged ions bonding due to electrostatic force;
			<kw>covalent bonds</kw> share electrons... making a covalent bond get it? cuz they share valent electrons? lol.
			anyway these are called <kw>molecular compounds</kw>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.3">
		<h2>&sect;3.3 taxation w/o representation*</h2>
		<p>
			<i>*i think this was a pun abt the original section name, idgi tho,,, mb something abt the molecular representations? idk it's just bad</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			just use <kw>chemical formulae</kw>: an <kw>emprical formula</kw> give relative amounts while <kw>molecular forumlae</kw> give actual numbers...
			a <kw>structural formula</kw> uses lines to represent the bonds, here's the book's shitty example:
			hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>): H-O-O-H...
			u can also represent geometry n double bonds w this shit n i feel like im going to throw up, not just bc the simplicity of this shit.
		</p>
		<p>
			molecular models are a thing (probably).
			a <kw>ball-n-stick molecular model</kw> uses... uh... balls... and the other thing... oh! sticks! to represent the molecule.
			whereas the <kw>space-filling molecular model</kw> fills in space!
			they mention tetrahedrons here but its not really important until later.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.4">
		<h2>&sect;3.4 an atomic view of stuff</h2>
		<p>
			i rly need to stop taking so long on these early chapters...
			<kw>atomic elements</kw> are typically themselves in anture whereas <kw>molecular elements</kw> aren't.
			<kw>molecular compounds</kw> are covalently bonded while <kw>ionic compounds</kw> are ionic bonded...
			the fewest conglomerated ions it takes to be electrically neutral is the <kw>formula unit</kw>.
			a <kw>polyatomic ion</kw> is an ion composed of poly atoms.
			SO TIRED DAMN!
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.5">
		<h2>&sect;3.5 ionic compounds - things!</h2>
		<p>
			many lame compounds are found in the crust cuz y not.
			so lets write them!
			first take two elements, find their charges, put the cation first, multiple their charges of w/e by numbers to get a balanced charge:
			i.e. Al<sup>3+</sup>, O<sup>2-</sup>... Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> easy as pie.
		</p>
		<p>
			elements have <kw>common names</kw> which are familiarities<sup>?</sup>, and <kw>systematic names</kw> which are found by a simple algorithm.
			normally one is metal n one non, and some elements just fuck w the naming convention.
		</p>
		<p>
			"naming binary ionic compounds containing a metal that forms only one type of cation"... <kw>name of cation + base name of anion + ide</kw>,
			i.e. calcium chloride...
			"naming binary compounds containing a metal that forms more than one kind of cation":
			same thing but w a charge in the middle: <kw>cation (charge) anion + ide</kw>
			i.e. copper (II) oxide...
			"naming ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions"... <kw>anion-cation</kw>, n here's a list of polyatomic iont to memorize:

			<kw>hydrated ionic compounds</kw> called <kw>hydrates</kw> contain a specific amount of water molecules per unit, measured in waters.
			these are named like <kw>compound prefix-hydrate</kw>, i.e. copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate.

	<div id="3.6">
		<h2>&sect;3.6 molecular things!</h2>
		<p>
			naming molecular compounds is fairly straighforward, for binary nonmetals it is: <kw>prefix-element prefix-elemenent-ide</kw>.
			mono is ommitted from the first one bc it got its ??? i.e. nitrogen monoxide.
		</p>
		<p>
			for now <kw>acids</kw> are molecules that emit a H<sup>+</sup>.
			<kw>Binary acids</kw> contain a hydrogen &amp; a non-metal, we name them <kw>hydro-element-ic acid</kw> i.e. hydrobromic acid.
			the spine is really hitting me today.* :l
			<kw>oxyacids</kw> are an acid with a hydrogen &amp; an oxyanion.
			if it's a -ate then <kw>oxyanion-ic acid</kw>, or -ite: <kw>oxyanion-ous acid</kw>.
			i.e. nitrate &rarr; nitric acid, sulfite &rarr; sulfurous acid.

	<div id="3.8">
		<h2>&sect;3.8 formula mass</h2>
		<p>
			the <kw>formula mass/molecular mass</kw> is
			$$\sum_{k=0}^n N_k*m_k$$
			where $n$ is the number of unique elements, $N_k$ is the number of element $k$ in the molecule, n $m_k$ is the atomic mass of element $k$.
			the molecular mass is numerically equivalent to the <kw>moral mass</kw> except the latter is in g/mol rather than amu.
			to get the ampount of molecules in a sample just divide the mass by the molar mass then multiple by <kw>Avogadro's number</kw>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.9">
		<h2>&sect;3.9 composition</h2>
		<p>
			$$P = \frac{m_x}{m_{mol}} \times 100%$$
			where $P$ is the percentage of the mass of a compound contributed by element $x$, $m_x$ is the mass of element $x$ in 1mol of the compound, n $m_{mol}$ is the mass of 1mol of the compound.
			if you're really cleaver this can get you the molecular formula...
			by measuring chemicals put in and their molar ratios.
			you can use <kw>empirical formula molar mass</kw> to make a ratio and from there get a full thing:
			$$F_{molecular} = \frac{m_{mol}}{m_{mol_{emp}}} \times F_{empirical}$$
			where $F_{molecular}$ is the molecular formula, $m_{mol}$ is the molar mass, $m_{mol_{emp}}$ is the empirical formula molar mass, n $F_{empirical}$ is the empricial formula.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="3.11">
		<h2>&sect;3.11 chemical equations</h2>
		<p>
			a <kw>chemical reaction</kw> is a reaction of chemicals, a <kw>combustion reaction</kw> is a specific type that a molecule combines w O<sub>2</sub> to make CO<sub>2</sub> &amp; H<sub>2</sub>O.
			we represent these w <kw>chemical equations</kw> such as: CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O... such that it goes reactants &rarr; products.
			these need to be <kw>balanced</kw> so that the same number of an element is on each side.
			we can also label states:

		<table style="width:100%">

				<td style="width:25%">State</td>

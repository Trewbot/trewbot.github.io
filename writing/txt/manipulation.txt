im scared to manipulate people
ive always known that i could
anyone has the capability if they put their mind to it
and it scared the shit out of me
i dont really get y
probably bc i was really into this whole
"illusion of choice" idea
n i never wanted to be the one to take it away
mb i just wanted to believe that i could control myself
that none of the evil i believed i was could ever come true
that i was just normal
n that i would fit in
n that if i didnt manipulate ppl
they would appreciate me for it

but its a catch 22
u cant not manipulate ppl
well
you can
but u cant do so while talking to them

ive been working on this cute little gravity thing
it was originally just to make an animation possible
bc i didnt want to manually animate it
then try to force it to be more versatile
to transition from any frame
i figured it was easier to just make a physics engine
it was really simple
each moon said 'that planet is what i orbit'
n they were only influenced by it as they intended

but thats bullshit
that was fake
it was oversimplified
ive been rewriting it
bc life doesnt work like that
everything influences everything
the moon even influences the planet
look at everyone favorite planet: pluto
its basically in a binary system
its influenced by its moon so much
n that is how i imagine relationships
a binary orbit
nice n stable
n ur together
n u wouldnt know what to do apart

if u start analyzing socialization
when u think 'why am i talking'
u start to rationalize it all
'im talking to this person bc they can help'
'we're working on this project together'
'i just want her to love me'
n everything u say is tailored to that end
if u agree on the goal
then every trail off of the main conversation
will be forced back in place
because that is what the both of you want
but if the goal is one sided
then u gotta do it urself
n if u dont
then isnt the whole thing
just a fucking waste to you?
arent u wasting yr time?
wasting yr effort?

u gotta realize
ALL
SOCIALIZATION
IS
MANIPULATION
its only sickening when u realize it
but that doesnt make it all bad
what u hate
the 'manipulation' u were trying to avoid
that isnt influence
that isnt control

what ur worried abt is destruction

u dont want ppl controlling others in a way that only they benefit

but what abt
if i lose everything
n u gain everything
does that make u the bad guy
or does it mean that i lost
am i manipulating u w my failure?
am i the bad guy?

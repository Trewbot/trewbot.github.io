the neighbors are always loud
n they smoke weed
n they control the temperature
its way too hot in here
the other night i was working on stuff
n i told myself id sleep when they were quiet
which was, yknow, 6:30am
n they dont smoke all that often
but theres like no filtering here
so the entire fucking apartment smells
when they play music
they used to at least
it would vibrate my floor
i could listen to my own music
to drown it out
but i could still feel it
they dont talk they yell
maybe they do talk
but i never hear it?
the old neighbors would talk
n i could hear them
so perhaps not,,,
but, like, they laugh
n it is loud as shit
n i hate it
n i want to die
n i hate life
n the world sucks

i couldnt imagine crying over something like this when i cant even cry over
all the things ive wanted to for so long... n yet its like this is the one that
continues to scare me regardless of how detached from it i get. i just... i cant
do anything, i spend all this time, i build up all this confidence to do some
little fucking thing then i bail on myself bc im just so inconsequential that i
couldnt be bothered to care abt something as simple as a promise to myself to do
something that ive only wanted to do just to have something to do while the time
passes by n yknow what? idek what letting the time pass accomplishes as i seem
to have lost all direction, there are no stepping stones left for which i can
simply sit and wait,

                     passing time is just waiting to die now

                     and yet i keep fucking doing it

                     bc i cant do anything else

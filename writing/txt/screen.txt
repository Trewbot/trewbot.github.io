we moved here over the summer
and obviously it was quite hot
theres no air conditioning for the whole house
so we needed to use the shitty air conditioner that was already here
eventually our great uncle has a spare
so we used that in one room
n the old one in my room

the north facing window in my room doesnt have a screen
which was convenient for the sake of an ac unit

there are three vents in my room
the heat comes right on in
we have no control over the heater
so the neighbor can pump as much in as they want
n i have 3 fucking vents
my room also retains heat quite well
n ive got these fucking computers here
that just make all this fucking heat
n i need to fucking open the windows
in the middle of what should be winter
but global warming
so it feels like spring mid february
but its absurd that i need to let in the winter air
just to be able to sleep

sometimes i look out my north facing window
it faces some trees
theres never really anyone in that area
the area it faces
but i can see outside
w/o having to see any people

there is a tire by the garage
n some litter by the trees
theres often a massive ice pool
during the winter that is
but something that i never really paid attention to
theres a screen out there
theres a fucking window screen
on the ground
right below my window
i could have the north facing window open
but no
the fucking screen is down there
on the fucking ground

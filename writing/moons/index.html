		"When I stepped off onto that moon, it felt lonely, sure, but I didn't feel alone.
		It was like if the girl you liked left you on read for months but she lived just across the hall, that sort of lonely,"
		he paused, just staring off into the distance as if deep in thought.
		"I don't know what it was.
		There was something.
		I could feel it, I could feel it ignoring me.
		I wanted it to love me, even though I had no idea who or what it was or if it even existed, I just needed it to validate my feelings."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Did you ever actually, y'know, find anything up there?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"No, I guess it was just a feeling.
		I expected emptiness, but instead I got this longing feeling.
		Like, I just wanted to say 'I'm home' and sit down at the table with her."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Her?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"The, uhh, herâ€¦ oh, shit, I really have no idea what I'm saying right now.
		It's all very confusing.
		I nearly collapsed crying up there, on that moon.
		Just thinking about everything that happened had got me holding back tears again."
		The man's voice began to crackle a bit, he was starting to sound like an old man reminiscing about a long-lost love from his days of youth.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Let me ask you again, then, did you ever actually meet her?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"What, no? I, what? I just, heh, I said I didn't..."
		he trailed off, his eyes began watering, a tear or two began rolling down his cheek.
		He really shouldn't be hiding anything, what is there to hide?
		It was all on camera.
		They already saw everything.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Look, Eric, we know what happened, we already saw everything.
		So, just answer me clearly now: did you or did you not see her when you were up there?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I fucking- I-I told you already, I fucking- I didn't meet-"

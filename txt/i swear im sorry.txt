i promise
i swear
i swear to god
i guess i dont believe in any gods
except you
so i swear upon my obsession
my belief in u as a god in my life
i swear

i wasnt

it wasnt

i didnt mean to scare you

it wasnt a threat

it wasnt even
supposed
to
     be
	      directed
		              _at_
			                   you
							   
it wasnt a joke either
it wasnt some obscure reference
i was in pain
n i wanted
you
i wanted you
if anyone
you to be the one that understood
how much it hurts
for me to be alive
how much i feel like dying
how on edge i am

it was so long ago
do you even remember
does it matter
either way
im so sorry
i hate myself
n this only made me hate myself more

i gave up
when ur stepfather called
n said he wanted to speak w me
n said that he didnt like what i said
n i said that i didnt care
i wasnt trying to be edgy
when he said he could call the cops
he was wrong
everyone was wrong abt that
but i still
did
not
care

i was tired then
n im tired now
its been almost two years
n im still tired

i want her to sit on top of me
n just fucking stab me

i want her to look me in my eyes
i want her to make me cry
she was the last person to make me cry
i havent cried
since then

it has been nearly two years
since ive actually cried

i want her to make me cry
i want her to do it
lay me down on the floor
sit on my waist
and just stab me repeatedly

im trying to imagine how it feels
to be stabbed
i imagine a lot of stinging
like a deep, pinpointed burning

thered probably be a bit of shock
like a delay in the feeling
but if it was her
id probably already be numb
just from seeing her again

shes not real
she is not real
she isnt real

she
is
not
real

she used to be real
she stopped being real
she has nothing to do with it anymore

i want her to stab me

i want her to be with me

im so alone

pls kill me

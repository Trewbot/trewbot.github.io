i dont feel nostalgia
at least not like 'oh i miss this show'
mostly bc i have like no sentiment
but i do feel nostalgia for one thing
when watching love stories
theres this sense of envy
paired with some of that nostalgia
bc i miss being able to love someone
i miss liking people
i miss not being bored of people
or sickened by the bland or bigoted shit they say
i dont really get it
was it me
or everyone else
or both?

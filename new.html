        Hello, welcome to my on-line homepage; I am Trevor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6glund">Hoglund</a>, a.k.a. Trewbot!
        I am a writer and developer, currently enrolled at the <a href="https://uwrf.edu">University of Wisconsin-River Falls</a> studying physics, mathematics, and computer science.
    </p>

        Writing
        <img src="assets/img/pen.gif" alt="★"/>
    </h2>
    <p>
        My writing interests range from fun comedy projects to super serious political discussions.
        Relevant to that, my political and philosophical interests are absurdism, accelerationism, anarcho-syndicalism, direct action/praxis, prefigurativism, technogaianism, technoprogressivism, and transhumanism.

        Developing
        <img src="assets/img/tea.gif" alt="★"/>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Unlike my writing, the programming and software development I do is a lot more closely related to my actual studies.
        I taught myself programming through web development in high school, and went on to apply to college as a computer science major.
        Due to certain issues with the program I was able to get into, this was eventually downgraded to a minor, with my major being changed to a double major in Physics and Mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the most part, my original focus on web development has held out over time.
        A lot of my works in physics and math, and even regular programming, have been either solely created for or adapted for the web.

# It's Not Like She Ever Loved Me

She died and there was nothing I could do, I just watched her die. I never really felt obligated to feel anything about that moment. There was nothing I could do, so why should I have wasted my mind away on caring so much about it. It's not like she ever loved me and to be quite honest I'm not sure I ever loved her.

Sure, I loved the _idea_ of her, but who didn't love the idea of her? Everyone loved the idea of her I wasn't special, nobody was special when it came to her. She was the only special one and we were all below her. Who the fuck did I think I was? Thinking that she would ever love me.

It was enough that I would worship her. I don't think she knew that I worshipped her, but I don't think that was really important. Perhaps she had learned to just expect everyone around her to worship her. It wouldn't have been ego, per se, it would simply be the observation of facts. People tended to worship her and in no way was I special in that regard.

Death has a funny way of changing the dynamics of things, shifting priorities, making things that were previously unimportant become important. I was there when she died, nobody can take that away from me. Maybe that's what I felt in that moment; I didn't feel sadness witnessing her death, but gratification that I was somehow special to her, that she would _allow_ me to witness her at the last moment of her existence.

What evidence is there that she allowed this? She was god, nothing happens around god without her willing it. Clearly she would have to allow it for it to happen. I could not so easily go against the will of a god and force myself into that final moment as nothing of the sort could happen in her presence.

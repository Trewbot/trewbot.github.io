# About Me

## Script

Opening shot of TREVOR standing in a corner of a basement, possibly standing in
the center of the frame.

                                    TREVOR
                    Hey, it's me, Trevor Hoglund...

TITLE: "Trevor Hoglund"

                                    TREVOR
                    ...and I'm BACK in SCHOOL.

TREVOR tilts his head and attempts a smile, but he's really not good at smiling.

CUT TO: Map of Twin Cities Metro, a cursor moves over to Minneapolis, circles a-
-round it a bit then clicks on it.
                                    TREVOR
                    In 1997, I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

CUT TO: The Wikipedia page for "Education in the United States" scrolling across
the screen.

                                    TREVOR
                    After some, uhh...

Midway through the sentence, the scene cuts to an old picture of TREVOR in a ba-
-sketball jersey. An annotation on the screen says that this is, in fact, TREVOR
and that he did at one point play sports in school. The screen then cuts back to
the Wikipedia page scrolling.

                                    TREVOR
                    ...intermediate events...

CUT TO: Image of some part of the University of Wisconsin-River Falls campus.

                                    TREVOR
                    ...I ended up here, at the University
                    of Wisconsin-River Falls. Where I am
                    in my Junior year.

CUT TO: Video of the UWRF High Power Rocket team's launch in 2016.

                                    TREVOR
                    Here I'm double majoring in Physics...

CUT TO: A screen recording of someone fiddling around with the Poisson graph at
https://trew.moe/js/phys/poisson

                                    TREVOR
                    ...and Mathematics. With a minor in...

CUT TO: Another screen recording, this time of scrolling through some mess of
code TREVOR has written.

                                    TREVOR
                    ...Computer Science.

CUT TO: A shot similar to the opening shot, with TREVOR in the basement, this
time with a brightly lit backdrop and more lights shining on him.

                                    TREVOR
                    My main hobbies are photography and
                    programming, the image of campus and
                    that Poisson graph being an example
                    of each respectively.

TREVOR points at two spots in front of the back drop and the previous shots of
the aforementioned picture and graph are placed on screen. After a couple sec-
-onds, TREVOR jumps over to the other side of the frame.

                                    TREVOR
                    Recently, I've also been getting inv-
                    -olved in some more writing and poli-
                    -tical projects.

TREVOR gestures widely at an area in front of the backdrop and several logos of
different projects he's involved in appear.

                                    TREVOR
                    But these recent endeavors are yet to
                    be as concrete as my other hobbies.

TREVOR tries feigning some sort of sadness or something.

CUT TO: A shot of TREVOR sitting on a palette in the same basement, holding his
legs together in a position similar to the fetal position.

                                    TREVOR
                    This has been a bit about me, I hope
                    you enjoyed the video.

The shot remains focused on TREVOR in this spot as the credits roll over the
screen.

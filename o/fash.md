## Fashion and Self Expression

- Usage to control people
    - Pockets in women's clothes
        - Deliberately lacking due to fear of women hiding weapons in their pockets (pocket_sand.gif)
    - General lack of utility (transition from &uarr;) and longevity in "fashionable" clothing forcing people to buy new clothing frequently or risk wearing clothes that are deteriorating, making the working class very visible in many circumstances, (transition to &darr;)
    - Expensive clothes for the rich, easier to distinguish people by class
    - Industry trends force people to spend more money to remain "in fashion" (esp w women)
        - Wasteful as they require old trend clothes to be purged from stores
        - Lower classes cannot afford to keep up w trends, see previous point (possibly use for transition?)
        - These trends are superficial associations with the industry as a whole rather than the self or community
        - Use as transition to next section &darr;
- Self Expression
    - Opposition to norms
        - Not necessarily contradictory to "fashion trends" so much as to basic formats traditionally associated as norms, e.g. skirts, thicker belts, knee socks, various shirt fits, etc. being considered "feminine"
        - But what then?
            - Is the opposition to the norm the new norm?
            - Will there be new norms to be opposed?
    - Non-compulsory uniforms
        - Make freely available a simple uniform representing a group
        - Clearly define a scheme to be associated with that group (i.e. a color or symbol)
            - This scheme gives people some manner to easily associate themselves with the group _if they choose to_
        - The community as a part of the self

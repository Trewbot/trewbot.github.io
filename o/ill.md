# Illusion of Choice:

1. You are constantly presented with many minor decisions to distract you from the few choices that truly matter.
    1. What do you want for lunch?
    1. Which shirt should you where today?
1. The choices you make are dictated by false dichotomies, often making you choose between two options only to have the same outcome (or a similar outcome) regardless of your decision.
    1. The two-party system.
    1. Competing brands owned by the same company.
1. By making these decisions you believe that you have control in a world where your life is all but predetermined by the powers that be.
    1. The actual psychological phenomenon of "illusion of choice."
1. Consistent perpetuation of the illusions of choice creates a culture wherein such illusions are expected if not viewed as optimal.
